# deep-learning-challenge

## Overview of the analysis: 
- The purpose of my analysis was to be able to predict with more accuracy on the deep learning model whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup

## Results
- Data Preprocessing: The variable 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' was the target for my model while the rest of the variables were the features for my model. In addition, 'EIN' and 'NAME' were variables removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
